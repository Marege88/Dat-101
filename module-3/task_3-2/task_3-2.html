      <li>[In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single for loop?]]</li>
      <p>[No, one loop to count up and one loop to count down]<p>
      
      <li>[can you create a infinate loop?]</li>
        <p>[Yes, if you put the condition outside of the targeted area]</p>
      
      <li>[Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
the program perform other tasks concurrently?]</li>

      <p>[Depends on what you mean by THIS, if you are talking about the assignment above it is working until its done and it depends on the targeted area]</p>

      <li>[Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
matter?]</li>
      <p>[Yes]</p>
